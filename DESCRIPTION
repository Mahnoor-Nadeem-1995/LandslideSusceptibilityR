Description: 
    LandslideSusceptibilityR allows users to generate landslide susceptibility maps with minimal inputs. 
    The package automatically downloads necessary Earth observation data (such as DEM, precipitation, fault lines),
    computes key causal factors (slope, aspect, flow accumulation, hillshade, precipitation, NDVI, distance to fault lines),
    and applies a globally trained Random Forest model (using the 'ranger' package) to predict landslide susceptibility. 
    The user only needs to provide a study area shapefile and a corresponding NDVI raster. 
    The pre-trained model was trained using NASA's Global Landslide Catalog (GLC) and absence points generated based on slope thresholds. 
    The model is fully global and requires no manual training data input from the user.
